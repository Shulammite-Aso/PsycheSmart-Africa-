#PsycheSmart Africa

In the long run, PsycheSmart Africa will be changed to just PsycheSmart and will be a blogging platform like medium, but will be dedicated to publishing contents around Mental well-being staying, I call it "everyday sanity". Will be an open source project, but once i have built out the basic features.
For now this project is still a simple website where i'll transfer all the post that was in psycheSmart Africa facebook page. The facebook page was basically used to create awareness about mental health disorders and neaurodevelopmental disorders like autism.
